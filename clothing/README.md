# Clothing

## Personalization using digital fabrication

Having personalized clothing is tricky&expensive when buying from niche,
and creating things from scratch is time-consuming & skill-intensive
due to lack of widely available automated fabrication of clothes.

So instead, lets try to "hack" 'standard' clothing to become more
inline with a peronal/niche style, using modern digital fabrication tools
like the 3d-printer and laser-cutter.

Falls into existing traditions of clothes modding, for instance by punks in the 80ies.


But with a focus on designs which can be easily reproduces across the world,
using standardized tools&material. The existing pieces of clothing become 'vitamins'
(in the Reprap terminology), and should be source-able locally from generic stores.

### Gothic ideas

I am particularly fond of 'gothic' style clothing.
Typical characteristics are

* Dark, monotone colors. Predominantly black. White sometimes as contrast.
Blood-red or burgundy/velvet sometimes used.
In some cases, muted earthy colors are used a little bit: brown, greens.
Notable exception is cybergoth, where near-neon blue/green/pink is used as accent.
* Particular materials: Velvet, leather, .
Modern variants sometimes (shiny) plastic/rubber/latex.
* Jewelry and details usually silver/steel/tin-look
* Fictional themes include, Vampires, (dark) angels, witches, occult, dragons
* Historical themes include, Victorian
* Nature inspirations: Crows, spiders, bats, snakes.
* Symbols: Bones, skulls, crosses, heart,
* Paricular accessory items: Cane, pocketwatch, gloves, tophat, umbrella
* Sometimes crosses with: Punk, steampunk, bondage/SM, folk/pagan

Items one could hack on existing clothing to gothify it:

* Straps
* Buttons
* Chainrings / chains

### Technique ideas

* Lasercut holes in one side only,
by placing a hard-to-cut. For instanace into a sleeve
* Print pieces two-sided, a visible front-piece and a backing which goes on inside of cloth.
Have the two pieces snap into eachother, glue or sow together - embedding the cloth in it.
* Design in holes/loops in pieces to be attached, which thread can easily catch from inside.
Can be either be hidden, or visible, possibly with intricate patterns with a colored thread.
* Use lasercutter to etch patterns, by removing (existing) dyes.
Maybe one can also using some activation chemical for coloring, similar to metal-etch paste?
* 3d-print positive and negative, use to emboss foil/sheets parts. Tin, copper etc.
* 3d-print, conductive material or pant -> electroplate with silver

## Utilitarian ideas

Not as in 'utility instead of beauty' but 'utility as beauty'.
Where the function of the piece is primary, and embelishment are secondary or tertiary.

Consider for instance items usually carried on ones person, like:
Money/creditcard/keys/id and a mobile device.
Some also carry beautification items,
and some carry tools of their trade (carpenters/electricians etc).

For these there are both security (making sure items are not easily lost or stolen),
and accessibility considerations (items must be easily found and retrieved).

Ideas:

* Credit-card or mobile-phone holder in sleave, or as bracers.
Could be a quick-release, magician style - that one can flick open.

### Fictional/Fantasy utilitarian

Nothing says utilitarian in fashion needs to be for this universe.
Imagine alternative universes, and how they might influence clothing:

* World without prevalent lighting, needing to carry personal lighting. Underground/post-apocalyptic etc.
* Water- or underwater-world.
* Living in trees/canopy.

Perhaps every item could tell a story of the universe it belongs to,
and the kind of person wearing it.

## Fashion is Facism

I am of the opinion that

    Modern-day 'fashion' is a facism driven by coorporations,
    trying to control what people wear in an attempt to make (more) money,
    playing off peoples want/need to associate with tribes or classes,
    and fear of not being accepted.
