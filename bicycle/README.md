Projects around or involving bikes/bicycles.

I worked for 6 years a bike salesman and mechanic at
Din Sykkel / [Sykkellåven](http://www.sykkellaven.no/) in Tønsberg while studying.

Projects
=====

Electricity generator
-----------------------

To keep in shape while being on the computer, and make the electricity useful instead of just going to.

Coupling:

Store-bought generators/loads are often coupled onto the tyre.
This wears a lot on the tyre, is not suitable for mountain-bike type tyres.
Instead we propose a replacement "wheel", where the generator is coupled 
onto the hub/casette or using a replacement hub.
Depending on motor/generator, gearing might be neccesary.

Motor:

Motor can be a 12/24V alternator from car/MC, sourced or recycled locally.
[Biltema](http://www.biltema.no/no/Bil---MC/Bilreservedeler/Elektrisk-anlegg/Dynamo/)
Alternative is to use brushless motor from RC/multicopter,
potentially requiring more complex charge control. HobbyKing etc.
Or ultimately, to be able to 3d-print the motor itself.

Many of the thing learned here could be useful for similar systems,
off-grid solutions like human powered water pumps etc.
Or to make an electric bicycle, or dual-purpose system,
which can both for excercise/generation and for transportation/motor.


TODO:

* Design initial concept models

3d-printed parts
------------------

With the eventual goal of being able to print, everything needed for a practical bike.
On a standard 20x20x20cm RepRap-style printer, not specialized machine.
Bigger structural elements like the frame, is considered a separate project, see below.

Some things are quite safety critical, like brake, propulsion and steering system.

Exists on Thingiverse, by other people:

* Pads for keeping hydraulic brakes safe when disc is out. [1](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:471166)
* Crank bolt tool [1](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:92353)
* Chain protection rings

Thingiverse searches:

* [Bike](http://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=bike&sa=)
* [Bicycle](http://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=bicycle&sa=)

TODO:

* Casette removal tool
* Casette offset ring, fitting 6-7gear casette on 8/9/10 hub
* Hub, using standard ball bearings. 608Z with M8 threaded rod axel?
* Drop-out. Hugely beneficial to 3d-print, due to hundreds of variations
* Remotes for suspension-forks


3d-printed bicycle structure
----------------

Bigger structural elements are particularly challenging to 3d-print on a
standard ~20x20x20cm RepRap-style printer.
Both due to the sizes of the objects, and requirements for structural integrity.

Ideas:

* Use glass/carbon/bio fiber+resin reinforcement on 3d-printed shell.
Vacuum-bag-form for production speed.

Parts:

* Frame
* Wheels
* Fork for frontwheel
* Seatpost
* Handlebars and stem
* Crank-arms
