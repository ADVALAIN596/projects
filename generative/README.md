# Applications

* Image/texture synthesis for webdesign
* Making unique 2/3d-models for digital fabrication
* Image filtering

# Ideas

## Obeying mechanical constraints
In order to move away from just "texturing" but creating significant changes,
that may also have functional/structural impact,
and ensuring these preserve usefulness of object.
Minimum height/width, material thickness or strength.


## Simulated life
Simulate a dynamic system defined by 2/3d-topology, where
simulated life influence the topology based on simple rules.
Kind of a Game-of-Life.


'Series' of objects can be done using the same system, where each object instance
is a diffent generation of the system.
