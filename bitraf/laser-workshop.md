# Extended course

Everyone comfortable with using the laser as a tool
Give a wide overview of possibilities, inspiration
Encourage experimentation, just-try-it-out
Encourage combination of techniques. Old&new
Encourage innovation, know what is already done, take it one-step further
Encourage sharing, both of techniques and designs

## Day 1

Basic safe usage, first cuts

Laser fundamentals

* Operation principle, how does a laser work
* implications for usage & design
** suitable material
** flat-ish surfaces, due to narrow range of focus
** non-zero cut width (kerf)
** v/angled cut profile due to focus
** hard-to-control
* comparison to 3d-printing
* comparison to CNC milling

* Raster versus engraving
* Settings. Speed, power, line-width

Safety

* Fire hazard
* Fume/gas hazard
* Mechanical hazards

Basic usage, demo/walkthrough

* Making a simple design
* Creating toolpaths
** selecting appropriate settings
* Running the job
** zeroing Z-axis
** setting job origin

First cuts

* each participant designs simple object
* makes it themselves on the laser
* supervised/guided by teacher


## Day 2

Design inspirations

TODO: add pictures/links

* no-sew, especially interesting for products which materials are reusable later.
* folding techniques: ex 14, 15 pillows
www.buzzfeed.com/peggy/easy-diy-projects-you-wont-believe-are-no-sew 

* cut and weave, 25
http://www.buzzfeed.com/juliegerstein/easy-no-sew-diy-clothing-hacks
* latticing
* lacing



* Finding existing designs online.
* License considerations
* Publishing designs online. Thingiverse/Umagine, Instructables

2d vector design

* in Inkscape
* document setup for laser. use mm, set workarea to piece or machine
* basic geometry, rectangles, circles
* aligning elements
* using elements/lines as guides
* node editing
* bezier paths
** splitting nodes
** node types 
* specifying precise measurements
* measuring/verifying sizes/distances
* text tools
* tracing bitmaps into vector. Ex from web, books or hand-drawings
* widening cutlines by stroke-to-path engraving
* using layers to organize
* using groups
* path offsets
* boolean operations
* exporting to laser considerations
** converting objects to path
** line width requirements for vector cutting
* working with patterns
seamless repetition http://verysimpledesigns.com/vectors/inkscape-tutorial-seamless-patterns.html
pattern along path http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/Paths-LivePathEffects-PatternAlongPath.html
* tweak tool, brush-type vectors molding
http://en.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/ch008_tweak-tool/

Working with textiles

* for clothing
* use to cut fabric for sewing, instead of pattern transfer
* cutouts, stitch marking, button/part marking
* use for modifying clothes already made
* decorative. Drapery, room-dividers, table cloth
* creating parts for Appliqu√©
* quilt fusing http://www.craftsy.com/blog/2013/05/quilt-fusing/
* no-sew fusible http://howtosew.com/blog/sewing-basics/no-sew-fusible-web http://sewing.about.com/od/fusibles/ss/fusibleoptions.htm#step1
* leathermaking
* cut stiching holes
* duo-color by selective removal of dye
* fusing of 
* TODO: find out if one can laser anti-fraying glues
* creating stenciles for dyeing, painting etc

* creating lines for seam-allowance (offset)

Lasering techniques

* avoiding backscatter marks, using backing plate
* cutting frontside only, using insert plate. Ex: existing clothes
* avoiding flaming/haloing, using masking tape
* multicolor by multi-layering
* duo-color by selective paint removal
* etching masks by
* de-focusing laser, for speed & effect
* aligning layers with alignment holes. Using pins, thread or light-table
* aligning layers with 


Advanced toolpathy things

* Hatching



## Day 3

Beyond 2d, making 3d objects. Combining textile

Design inspirations

* frames for stretching out textile
* textile-clad parts. Boxes, lamp shade

* rolling, 27 pencil holder
www.buzzfeed.com/peggy/easy-diy-projects-you-wont-believe-are-no-sew
* textile as holder , 14 book sling
http://www.brit.co/no-sew-projects/

Construction techniques

* Accounting for laser kerf
* Building 3d objects from 2d sheets
* Joinery & fitting
* Glue/screws assembly

Making tools

* Leather stiching pony, like http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008885TUW
