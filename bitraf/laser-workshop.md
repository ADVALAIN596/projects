# Extended course

Goals

* Everyone comfortable with using the laser as a tool
* Give a wide overview of possibilities, inspiration

Style

* Encourage experimentation, just-try-it-out
* Encourage combination of techniques. Old&new
* Encourage sharing, both of techniques and designs
* Encourage innovation, know what is already done, take it one-step further

## Day 1

Basic safe usage, first cuts

## Laser fundamentals

### Operation princeiple

How does a laser work

* Running [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPWBrISBOtA)
* Principle [1](http://am.co.za/picture/cnc-laser-system.png) [alt](http://cnccheap.com/image/pic/image095.jpg)
* [Epilog picture](https://www.epiloglaser.com/assets/img/products/fusion-motion.jpg)
* Focused beam [1](http://www.rowmark.com/MARK/laser_guide/images/intrlsr/Lsrop.jpg)
[2](http://www.spikenzielabs.com/SpikenzieLabs/Laser_How_To_files/Picture%2017.png)

### Implications for usage & design

* flat-ish surfaces, due to narrow range of focus
* not all material burns nicely
* non-zero cut width (kerf)
* v/angled cut profile due to focus
* hard-to-control depth

### Comparison to 3d-printing

* subtractive instead of additive
* more materials
* much faster

#### Comparison to CNC-milling

* less settings
* faster setup-time

#### Controlling the laser

* gcode / instructions, hand-write
* CAD, designing/drawing the geometry
* CAM, program converts design to code/instructions
* Raster versus vector
* Cutting versus engraving
* Settings. Speed, power, line-width

## Safety

* Fire hazard
* Fume/gas hazard
* Mechanical hazards

## Basic usage, demo/walkthrough

* Making a simple design
* Transferring over to laser PC

Creating toolpaths

* selecting appropriate settings

Running the job

* pre-checks
* zeroing Z-axis
* setting job origin


## First cuts

* each participant designs simple object
* makes it themselves on the laser
* supervised/guided by teacher

## Inkscape

2d vector design

* in Inkscape
* document setup for laser. use mm, set workarea to piece or machine

Object tools

* basic geometry, rectangles, circles
* aligning elements
* using elements/lines as guides

Beziers

* node editing
* control points
* splitting nodes
* node types 

Working precicely

* specifying precise measurements
* measuring/verifying sizes/distances

Text

* text tools
* tracing bitmaps into vector. Ex from web, books or hand-drawings
* widening cutlines by stroke-to-path engraving

Organizing

* using layers to organize
* using groups
* distributing elements

Other tools

* path offsets
* boolean operations

Exporting to laser

* SVG for Epilog, other machines use DXF
* converting objects to path
* line width requirements for vector cutting

Advanced

* working with patterns
seamless repetition http://verysimpledesigns.com/vectors/inkscape-tutorial-seamless-patterns.html
pattern along path http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/Paths-LivePathEffects-PatternAlongPath.html
* tweak tool, brush-type vectors molding

## Day 2

Design inspirations

TODO: add pictures/links

* no-sew, especially interesting for products which materials are reusable later.
* folding techniques: ex 14, 15 pillows
www.buzzfeed.com/peggy/easy-diy-projects-you-wont-believe-are-no-sew 

* cut and weave, 25
http://www.buzzfeed.com/juliegerstein/easy-no-sew-diy-clothing-hacks
* latticing
* lacing

* folding, [slippers](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29880)

* Finding existing designs online.
* License considerations
* Publishing designs online. Thingiverse/Umagine, Instructables

Working with textiles

* for clothing
* use to cut fabric for sewing, instead of pattern transfer
* cutouts, stitch marking, button/part marking
* use for modifying clothes already made
* decorative. Drapery, room-dividers, table cloth
* creating parts for Appliqu√©
* quilt fusing http://www.craftsy.com/blog/2013/05/quilt-fusing/
* no-sew fusible http://howtosew.com/blog/sewing-basics/no-sew-fusible-web http://sewing.about.com/od/fusibles/ss/fusibleoptions.htm#step1
* leathermaking
* cut stiching holes
* duo-color by selective removal of dye
* fusing of 
* TODO: find out if one can laser anti-fraying glues
* creating stenciles for dyeing, painting etc
* creating lines for seam-allowance (offset)

Lasering techniques

* avoiding backscatter marks, using backing plate
* cutting frontside only, using insert plate. Ex: existing clothes
* avoiding flaming/haloing, using masking tape
* multicolor by multi-layering
* duo-color by selective paint removal
* etching masks by
* de-focusing laser, for speed & effect
* aligning layers with alignment holes. Using pins, thread or light-table
* aligning layers with 


Advanced toolpathy things

* Hatching


## Day 3
