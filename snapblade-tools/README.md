Works OK for medium- and thick paper, as well as cardboard.
Thin paper and other soft/flexible material does not work well when attempting to use shearing motion, but the blades are so sharp that they are easily cut just by slicing though.
Also succesfully tested cutting small electronics wires, small plastic pieces, including 2.85 mm PLA filament.

Vitamins needed:

* 2x 18 mm snap-off blades
* 1x M5 locknut
* 1x M5 bolt 16mm+
* 2x M5 washers

Print 2 pieces of the simple-scissors STL (approx 15-20 mins per piece).
Snap off 3 pieces of each blade before inserting into slot in printed part.

Possible improvements:

* Angle the blades slightly towards eachother
* Devise mechanism to make clamping it down cause blades to tighten towards eachother.
