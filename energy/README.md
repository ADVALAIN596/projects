# Wind turbines

Vertical designs can collect wind from all sides, and exploit gusty winds, making them suitable for more different sites.
Small to medium horizontal designs get this property by letting the body spin to meet the wind, and using rotors.

Standard vertical windmills have significant torque ripple. Sweeping the blades to form a helical turbine eliminates this.
The most common design is a Darrieus, which uses the lift of airfoils. Its major problem is that it is inherently
[not self-starting](http://forthewind.weebly.com/the-darrieus-self-starting-problem.html).

Using a Darrieus/Savonius hybrid is the simplest solution, but reduces maximum efficiency.
More original solutions includes foldable [airfoils](http://www.webalice.it/acecere48/finalreport.pdf)

## Airfoil design

[NACA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil) is a series of airfoil designs, defined by a formula with 4/5 parameters.
These are commonly used and well-understood. Airfoiltools.com has [a calculator](http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/naca4digit).

[Xfoil](http://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/) is an open-source (GPL) software for simulating airfoils.

## Siting

Where turbines should be positioned to be efficient.

In an off-the-grid setting, most important is that there is good wind when there is bad sun? Ie winter

# Generators

DC voltage generation generally is easier than AC mains, because not needing to regulate the frequency, and can use many poles.
Efficient and cheap DC/DC converters, as well as inverter electronics for AC mains voltage exists.

Seems to use an original stator configuration, which is claimed to be more efficient and easy to construct.

# Vertical turbines

* Using a [single-side consentrator](https://youtu.be/NiHG5ahf4zQ?t=945), increasing efficiency `from <20% to 30% efficiency`
