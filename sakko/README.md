# Sakko

Sakko is an old game, played by people of the Lyngen area.
It was [rediscovered](http://www.fablab.no/index.php/news-nyheter/229-206) at MIT Fablab Norway,
and you can fabricate the pieces & board [with a mill](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/cs482/fablab/projects/sakko/).

Made at Nordic Fablab Bootcamp 2015.

## Figurines

The figurines were created by taking pictures of people, lit up by a flashlight, against a white background (a toolshed).
This captures their silluette, making for a super-simple '2d scanning' technique.
Then the images was imported into Inkscape, and using [Trace Bitmap](https://inkscape.org/en/doc/tracing/tutorial-tracing.html)
to convert it into vector shapes.
