Programming should be more visual, and interactive - engaging our spatial-visual cognitive abilities more,
as well as our tendency to explore and develop intuitive understandings of complex systems.

There are several aspects of this

1. Structure of programs. What pieces they consist of and how these pieces connected and interact.
2. The data processed by our, including the possible ranges of data, and how data changes during execution.
3. Models of the domain that the program operates on/within. How program behavior influence, and is influenced by this.

Each of these aspects may be useful on its own, however the major benefits might not appear until
each of the apects are present *and* that they are interconnected, supporting eachother.

## Visual programming

* Node-based dataflow programming, as used in [Flowhub](http://flowhub.io).
* Imperative visual programs, like MIT scratch.
* Ladder-based programming, used for PLS
* Visual graph notation used in finite state machines.
* Callstack analysis/visualiztion of imperative/functional code.


## Datavisualizion

`{ x: 1.0, y: 3.0 }` (most likely) represents a point in 2d space.
It should be visualizable and manipulatable as such.

Data in the FBP protocol is primarily represented as JSON.


TODO: include notes from paper, 2015-2016.

## Models

Most evident when working with programs that interact with the "real-world",
for instance robotics, 3d-modelling, transportation.

Other programs which operate on/within an "environment".
This can be software-defined networking, cloud computing orchestration, user behavior analysis (for sales or UX).



Support development of mental models, both initial creation and refinement.
Right now these only exist within heads of people, or in best case in an outdated documentation artifact.



"simulation-driven development".
Built an interactive model, which is used for simulations of scenarios.
Possible to drive programatically and with user-interface.

Similar to "model-based", but not attempting to be a mathematically rigorous system.
Model to the extent that is practical. Start rough, refine as needed and as understanding improves.

Existing

* Physics simulator in EDA (electronic design automation) tools, like SPICE.
