Selectively lighting up using UV-activated flourecent pigment

Ideally the pigment is transparent when not lit.

LEDs-strips would be preferrable for ease-of-placement.

## Lights

Ideally the UV lightsource is not seen apart from its effect on the pigment.
Might mean that lower wavelength (365 nm) UV-B/UV-C is preferrable to UV-A (395nm)?

## Flourecense

* Tonic water gives blue due to quinine.
* Vitamin B2 fluoresces yellow
* Laudry detergents and other optical brighteners give a blue light
* Some soaps contain Pyranine and gives green/yellow.
* Clorophyll in a solution gives red. 
* Extracting from marker pens. Supposedly doable with just water. [Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Make-Invisible-Ink-3/)

Sunscreen blocks UV

## Ideas

* Put transparent pigment on glass door. Sense touching door/handle using capacitive sensing, activate UV to show pigments.
Possibly also reduce ambient light inversely to increase the effect.
* Embed pigment in many small crystals or glass pieces.
Light up with UV leds from the inside. Animate the leds to create patterns. Use hidden distance or capacitive
