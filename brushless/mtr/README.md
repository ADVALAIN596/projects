# Mtr: stepper controller+driver firmware

## Designed for

* Bipolar stepper motors
* Driving H-brige directly (discrete or integrated)
* Single motor/axis per microcontroller
* Per-axis kinematics handling (acceleration, positioning)
* Taking config+movement commands over I2C or serial
* With ability to syncronize multiple instances for multi-axis/tool systems
* Possibility of current limiting motor windings
* Possibility of closed-loop feedback
* Primarily running on ARM Cortex, secondarily on AVR 8bit (Arduino)
* Ability to be end2end tested, both on host/emulated and on-device
