# Open source automation

Accessible general-purpose digital fabrication tools,
in combination with open source designs, hardware and software,
makes it feasible to also create small-scale (and local) special-purpose
automation.

In a world where globalized large-scale specialized production is the norm,
specialization may be needed in order to compete on cost/time per unit.
