Research in end-to-end, local and systainable, use of bioplastic.

from raw materials that can be grown,
to useful produced items,
to recycling of the items at end of life.

Using high-technology, low-scale and low-labor intensity processes.


Production techniques
---------------------

* Vacumforming
* 3d-printing
* Molding
* Extrusion & CNC mill

Polymer sources
--------

* Starch (potato, corn, agar)
* Protein (soy/whey, casein)
* Cellulouse (wood)
* Lignin (wood)

Extraction and polymerization processes
---------------------------

* Chemically
* Mechanically
* Biologically (bacteria)

Recyling processes
------------------

* HDPE: shred, reheat, use directly for vacumforming
* HDPE: shred, reheat, press into sheets. Thick for milling, thin for vacumforming later
* HDPE: shred, reheat, extrude into rough additive shape, mill finishing
* LDPE: mix with stearine wax, use as mold material with milling

Tools
------
1) start/bootstrap
2) scalable: automated/reproducible

* Shredder: 1) cut manually w/scissors 2) paper shredder, wood shredder???
* Heater: 1) Soldering/kitchen oven 2) CNC/laser MDF/HDF + wirewound/infraheater
* Frames: 1) Make from scrapwood 2) CNC/laser MDF
* Plate press: 1) scrapwood + clamps 2) CNC/laser MDF/HDF + 
* Vacuum table: 1) Make from scrapwood 2) CNC/laser MDF

Interesting objects to make
--------------------------

* Snapblade scissors
* Snapblade foodslicer

Challenges
-----------

# Hydrophilic

Most bioplastic interact with water, and properties vary due to it.

One alternative is to apply a coating, that is bio-friendly and easy to produce locally.

* Bieswax
* Lanolin (sheep wool wax)
* Soy wax, from soy oil

# Tensile strength

Typically low for bioplastics.

Migitation ideas

* Strengthen using complex geometric micro/macro structures (3d print etc)
* Strengthen by adding fibers, from celloluse, hemp/jute etc
