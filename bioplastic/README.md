Research in end-to-end, local and systainable, use of bioplastic.

from raw materials that can be grown,
to useful produced items,
to recycling of the items at end of life.

Using high-technology, low-scale and low-labor intensity processes.

Starch-based hydrolysis
-----------------------

During weekend of March 14-15, a series of simple starch-based plastics was created using hydrolysis.
Gelatine, corn-starch and agar was used as starch sources. Glyserol was used as the plasticizer.
The material was spread into thin sheets, 0.5 mm - 2 mm.
Both on its own, onto cotton fabric and mixed with wood filler.

Take-aways

* Drying under a oven heater drastically improves drying time, down to 3-4 hours for ~1 mm.
* Fabric sheets will warp if only dried from one side and tend to curl up fabric.
* Drying on aluminum sheets seems to keep warping down
* When drying on platic/alu, the side that is down does not dry out (as water cannot escape)
* Maintaining even dimension impossible when spreading plastic out with spatula
* Pouring into a base mold, taking out to dry when solidified, yielded relatively consistent height
* Olive oil worked excellently as a mold release agent (with gelatine-based plastic)
* Recipies that use a lot of water (10-100 parts to 1 part starch) seem to primarily takes longer to cook/dry
Around 5 parts starch to water is enough for the hydrolysis. Breakdown of the amylose is unknown.
* **Sensitivity to water** is a problem. When the finished plastic is exposed to water, it dissolves

Conclusion

The plastic was very easy to create with low amounts of water, but the hydroscopic nature drastically
reduces possible applications.

Next steps

* Attempt a protein (casein) based plastic/rubber, denatured with tannic acid
* Attempt a propein (casein) based plastic, hardened with Ammonium Alum
* Attempt to mix casein plastic with starch-plastic , see if water insolubility is preserved
* Research polymerizing in another type of solution (methanol? alkali? etc)

Ideas

Production techniques
---------------------

* Vacumforming
* 3d-printing
* Molding
* Extrusion & CNC mill
* Foam-production and cutting

Polymer sources
----------------

* Starch (potato, corn, agar)
* Protein (soy/whey, casein)
* Cellulouse (wood)
* Lignin (wood)

Extraction and polymerization processes
---------------------------

* Chemically
* Mechanically
* Biologically (bacteria)

Recyling processes
------------------

Bioplastic

* PLA + wood fill produced by milling -> remelt, sheet material for new milling

Non-bioplastic

* HDPE: shred, reheat, use directly for vacumforming
* HDPE: shred, reheat, press into sheets. Thick for milling, thin for vacumforming later
* HDPE: shred, reheat, extrude into rough additive shape, mill finishing
* LDPE: mix with stearine wax, use as mold material with milling

Tools
------
1) start/bootstrap
2) scalable: automated/reproducible

* Shredder: 1) cut manually w/scissors 2) paper shredder, wood shredder???
* Heater: 1) Soldering/kitchen oven 2) CNC/laser MDF/HDF + wirewound/infraheater
* Frames: 1) Make from scrapwood 2) CNC/laser MDF
* Plate press: 1) scrapwood + clamps 2) CNC/laser MDF/HDF + 
* Vacuum table: 1) Make from scrapwood 2) CNC/laser MDF
* Magnet stirrer, when doing hydrolysis of plastic

Can a similar type shredder be build using bicyle gears/sprockets?

Interesting objects to make
--------------------------

* Snapblade scissors
* Snapblade foodslicer

Challenges
-----------

# Hydrophilic

Most bioplastic interact with water, and properties vary due to it.
http://green-plastics.net/posts/70/qaa-can-i-make-waterproof-bioplastic/

One alternative is to apply a coating, that is bio-friendly and easy to produce locally.

* Bieswax
* Lanolin (sheep wool wax)
* Soy wax, from soy oil

# Tensile strength

Typically low for bioplastics.

Migitation ideas

* Strengthen using complex geometric micro/macro structures (3d print etc)
* Strengthen by adding fibers, from celloluse, hemp/jute etc
