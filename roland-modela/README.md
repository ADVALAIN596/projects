# Parts for Roland Modela

Designed for Roland Modela MDX-15 at [Bitraf](http://bitraf.no) hackerspace.

## Clamping system

Designed to be milled on the Modela itself, from 5-8 mm material. The roundclamp is 3d-printed.

The base doubles as a sacrificial layer, and can be planed by the mill to ensure perfect flatness.
Full worksize plates can be fixed with the sideclamps only, smaller pieces.
You can still use double-sided tape, if that is preferred.

Vitamins needed:

* 4 M4x30mm hex bolts (for sideclamps)
* 20 M4 nuts (for underside)
* 2 M4x10mm Allen screws

Parts:

* Base 2x
