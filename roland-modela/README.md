## Clamping system

![Clamping system "Clamping system"](./doc/clamping-system.jpg)

Designed to be milled on the Modela itself, from 5-8 mm material, using ~2mm endmill.
The roundclamp is 3d-printed.

The base doubles as a sacrificial layer, and can be planed by the mill to ensure perfect flatness.
Full worksize plates can be fixed with the sideclamps only,
smaller pieces with the roundclamps or combination of side+roundclamp.
You can still use double-sided tape, if that is preferred. 

Vitamins needed:

* 4 M4x30mm hex bolts (for sideclamps)
* 20 M4 nuts (for underside)
* 2 M4x10mm Allen screws

Parts:

* Base 2x
