## Learning

[Music Hacker - S2E6 - Trance Melodies in LMMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3rIduNXSgs).
Really well explained technique for creating (upbeat) trance melodies. Based on a basic chord progression, with transition notes to create a motif, then basing the supersaw bass+melody on that. Using alternating. Nice sounding SuperSaw synth. This style could be used for EBM.

[Music Hacker - S2E5 - vocals, samples, loops, and autotuning in LMMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSqorcfHgxc&t=845s).The vocoder with whitenoise input can be used to morph vocals for a harsh EBM sound.

Best practice: Each instrument/voice should be on its own effects channel, for easy mixing.

[Fl Studio Tutorial: EBM or Darkwave PT 1](https://youtu.be/iEJR2i9orDs?t=63).
Using a arpeggiator with a trance lead to get an interesting sound out of simple chord progressions.

[How to get harsh electro aggrotech vocals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSwJRtn5jd8).
Modding screams to sound harsher. Not great sounding but the basic sound is there.
Using a filter chain with compressor, pitchshift, delay, distortion/overdrive.

[Music Hacker - S2E4 - Vocal effects and processing in Audacity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQW358Ikh8s).
First normalize to near-max amplitude.
Leave a good amount of no-sound recording before and after the recording. Use this as the noise profile and remove using Denoise.
Use select and apply Amplitude effect to bring up lower volume utterances. Then trim exactly to just the vocal parts.
Also showing how to creating more interesting, or backing-like vocals sounds by duplicating the track,
and slightly offsetting the time some clicks, and changing the pitch by couple of semitones

[How To Make Synthpop P1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI21J9WtsMk). Not very synthpopy, more chillwave.
Using a bit of shared effects on drums to make them more cohesive. Compressor+EQ.
Very nice easy synth created by a squarewave one octave down, then a saw at normal octave, with a mildly resonant lowpass.
Baseline basically just repeated 16ths on same note. Started with single note, then after creating some melody move it to follow a chord progression with some walking. 
Side-chaining the bassline by the drums to make it a bit clearer.
Really nice visualization tools in FL Studio on the Parametric Equalizer and Limiter,
where current sound is overlayed into.

[Sound like Deadmau5 with LMMS](https://youtu.be/zDjkhdUPJ74?t=641).
Shows how to do side-chain compressor thing in LMMS. Otherwise not so interesting.

[Making an Industrial/Aggrotech Track - PART 2 (SNARE)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rraXXAV9uHM). In FL Studio.
Using layered samples. Should be relatively long ones, as this is common in aggrotech.
Also layering in a synth snare with a bandpassed white-noise.

[Making an Industrial/Aggrotech Track - PART 4 (BASSLINE)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD_xhZdyzKU). Nice synth sound.
Mentions that the bassline is typically on the off-beat (from the kick).
Bassline with a semitone raise at the end of loop is a common sound. Or alternatively drop down.
Using two layers of saw/Supersaw primarily. But also using a smooth sine at the way low end.

[FL Studio: Melodies & Bassline + Theory = Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMQZf8Aa1zs).
Minor scale common in electronic music.
Simple loop of a chord progression using 3 notes over 4 measures. Mentions that half-measure end of loop is common.
First creating chords for the melody based on the progression. Can be as simple as same chord all the time!
Then split/replace with notes of that being played independently to create a base motif. Then create variations.
In LMMS pianoroll, have to right-click on the keyboard. 

[FL Studio: The Basics of House Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EA_GULQtzA).
First 10 mintes, lots of good mastering tips.
Master kick to 0db with compressor/level, then adjust others accordingly.
Neat tricks for positioning sounds. Pan left/right with LFO, and an invert left/right effect
causing sounds like it comes from back of headphones.
