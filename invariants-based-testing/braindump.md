By stating some 'invariants' or 'properties' that should hold over a range of inputs,
we can more exaustively test a system compared to example-based (unit-testing etc).

# Property-based testing

* [Theft](https://github.com/silentbicycle/theft), property-based-testing for C
* [Property-based testing in ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/property_based_testing)
* [JsVerify](http://jsverify.github.io/)
* [Property-based testing without framework in CoffeeScript](https://graeme-lockley.github.io/posts/20160201-coffeescript_string_calculator_with_predicate_tests/)
* [quick_check.js](https://github.com/gampleman/quick_check.js/), includes lots of combinators

> Many partial and fragmentary open-source tools claim to be "quickcheck clones" but they lack two really important parts: search-space optimization and failure minimization
